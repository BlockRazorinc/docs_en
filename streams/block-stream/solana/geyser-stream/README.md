# Geyser Stream

### Introduction

**What is Geyser Stream**

Geyser is a plugin mechanism for Solana validators that enables real-time transmission of Solana's account, slot, block, and transaction data to external data storage media. Geyser Stream is a high-performance Solana data streaming service launched by BlockRazor based on the Yellowstone gRPC (Geyser plugin), allowing clients to subscribe to real-time Solana data streams with extremely low latency via the gRPC protocol.

**Applications of Geyser Stream**

Transaction Monitoring: Track transactions for specific accounts, ideal for following smart money trades or targeting new token launches on platforms like pump.fun.

Account Balance Tracking: Monitor balance changes in designated accounts, enabling real-time price calculations for token pairs in DEX pools (e.g., Raydium, Orca, Jupiter).

Block & Slot Insights: Analyze blocks and slots to assess network consensus and health status.

**Key Features of Geyser Stream**

High Performance: Geyser Stream delivers gRPC data streams to clients with ultra-low latency in real time.

Data Integrity: Supports transaction replay for the most recent 500 slots (200 seconds), ensuring seamless data continuity during disconnections.

High Stability: Operates across multiple cloud instances with seamless failover, guaranteeing long-term reliability.

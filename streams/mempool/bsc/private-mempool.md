# Private Mempool

### What is BSC Private Mempool

BSC Private Mempool is a private pending transaction service provided by BlockRazor, used to obtain private orderflow from BlockRazor RPC.

Unlike Public Mempool, which subscribes to pending transactions in public distribution, Private Mempool focuses on private transaction data that hasn't entered the public distribution path. This data is pushed via the SSE protocol, allowing users to directly parse, filter, and process it within their strategy systems. Private Mempool performs uniform anonymization on transaction content, disclosing only the transaction fields authorized for public access. This balances data privacy with the retention of critical information needed for strategy analysis.

### Scenarios of BSC Private Mempool

Private Mempool is suitable for users who want to monitor, judge, and execute strategies around private orderflows. Common scenarios include backrunning, copy trading, and sniping.

* **Backrunning**: When a trade appears in the private orderflow that may trigger arbitrage opportunities, users can construct a backrun trade based on these signals and execute the strategy after the target trade.
* **Copy Trading**: When target addresses, strategy accounts, or specific types of transactions appear in the private orderflow, users can identify these copy trading signals earlier and build follow strategies around actions such as buying, selling, adding to positions, or adjusting positions.
* Sniping: Identify key signals from private orderflow as early as possible when new pools are created, liquidity is injected, tokens open, or specific target trades are about to trigger market changes, providing an earlier response window for quick entry, signal following, and other timing-sensitive strategies.

### Why choose BSC Private Mempool?

In the BSC scenario, many high-value transactions do not appear in the public Mempool, but are instead included via a private routing provided by BlockRazor RPC. For users who want to build strategies around these transactions, waiting until the transactions are finally included to capture signals often means missing more valuable processing opportunities.

Private Mempool relies on [BEF](../../../core-technology/blockchain-edge-fabric.md) to provide users in different regions with access to private orderflow, enabling users to conduct earlier analysis and decisions based on the private transactions.

### Endpoint

{% hint style="info" %}
* Please keep the domain for subscribing to bundles consistent with the domain for sending bundles. For example, if you subscribe to `https://jp-bscscutum.blockrazor.xyz/stream`, send bundles to `https://jp-bscscutum.blockrazor.xyz`.
* Private data streams vary across regions. It is recommended to subscribe to all three endpoints simultaneously.

### Data Stream Type

#### **Raw Bundle**

Raw Bundle refers to the bundle that has not been followed by the strategy transaction. Transactions in Raw Bundle come from two channels.

Transactions submitted through `eth_sendRawTransaction` will be automatically constructed as a bundle by BlockRazor RPC and pushed to Private Mempool. The Raw Bundle in this scenario only contains one transaction;

For the Raw Bundle submitted through `eth_sendMevBundle`, the transactions come from the public mempool or are self-constructed. The Raw Bundle in this scenario can contain up to 50 transactions.

#### Followed Bundle

After the client executes the backrun, coping trading or sniping strategy on Raw Bundle, it can choose to continue to disclose the bundle to Private Mempool to execute the nested backrun strategy. At this time, the bundle disclosed to the Private Mempool is the Followed Bundle, which contains all transactions in Raw Bundle, and one strategy transaction.

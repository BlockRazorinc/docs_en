# Trading Bot

In onchain trading, a Trading Bot's competitiveness depends not only on its strategy, but also on two critical dimensions of speed:

1. **Signal monitoring speed**: How early the bot can detect a new pool, market-opening event, or target-wallet transaction.
2. **Transaction submission speed**: How quickly the bot can deliver a transaction to a Leader, Builder, Validator, or Sequencer.

The complete transaction path is as follows:

> Onchain event → Signal monitoring and parsing → Strategy evaluation → Transaction construction and signing → Transaction submission → Ordering node receives the transaction → Onchain inclusion

Signal monitoring determines when a bot can act, while transaction submission determines when its transaction reaches the chain. Latency at either stage can eliminate the strategy's original advantage.

### Typical Trading Bot Scenarios

#### **Sniper**

A Sniper Bot monitors new token deployments, new liquidity pools, market-opening transactions, or other predefined events. Once a target signal appears, it immediately constructs and submits a transaction.

Its primary objective is to discover trading opportunities earlier, enter the target block or slot, and secure a more favorable ordering position.

#### **Copy Trading**

A Copy Trading Bot monitors the buys, sells, or position changes of a designated Leader wallet. It then constructs a Follower transaction according to predefined amounts, ratios, and strategy rules.

Its primary objective is to reduce the inclusion-time gap between the Leader and Follower and minimize their execution-price difference.

Sniper and Copy Trading Bots monitor different targets: the former focuses on new pools, market openings, and contract events, while the latter focuses on designated wallet activity. However, both depend on the same underlying path: receiving signals, parsing signals, constructing transactions, and submitting them quickly.

### Trading Bot Pain Points

#### **Pain Point 1: Slow Signal Monitoring**

**Waiting for complete blocks delays signals**

Standard RPC or WebSocket services often deliver transaction data only after a node has received, processed, or even reconstructed a block.

This can mean:

* A competitor has already submitted a transaction when a Sniper Bot detects a new pool.
* The market price has already changed when a Copy Trading Bot detects the Leader's transaction.
* The original opportunity decays while the bot waits for data.

**Public nodes introduce longer data paths**

Public nodes may introduce cross-region transmission, multiple proxy layers, shared-resource queues, rate limits during peak traffic, and connection jitter.

Even a difference of tens of milliseconds can directly affect the final execution position in competitive Sniper and Copy Trading scenarios.

**A single data source provides limited signal coverage**

On chains that support Pending Transactions, public and private transactions may propagate through different paths:

* Public Mempool mainly covers publicly broadcast Pending Transactions.
* Private transactions may not appear in the Public Mempool.
* Confirmed onchain signals offer greater certainty but arrive later.

A Trading Bot should select Pending data, private order flow, or block data according to its target chain and strategy.

#### **Pain Point 2: Slow Transaction Submission**

Receiving a signal first does not guarantee execution first. After strategy evaluation, a transaction may still pass through a public RPC, proxy layers, cross-region networks, and intermediate relay nodes.

These stages consume the lead gained during signal monitoring and can cause:

* A Sniper Bot to miss the target block or slot.
* A Copy Trading Bot to land several blocks behind the Leader.
* A Follower to receive a materially worse execution price than the Leader.
* A transaction to fail because the market state has changed.

The destination that must receive a transaction quickly differs by chain:

<table><thead><tr><th width="170.10546875">Chain</th><th width="211.27734375">Transaction Destination</th><th>Primary Speed Consideration</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Solana</td><td>Current and upcoming Leaders</td><td>Leader routing and SWQoS transmission</td></tr><tr><td>Ethereum</td><td>Builder / Validator</td><td>Faster entry into propagation and block-building paths</td></tr><tr><td>BSC</td><td>Builder / Validator</td><td>Reaching the target block's processing window in time</td></tr><tr><td>Base</td><td>Sequencer</td><td>Shortening the transaction path to the Sequencer</td></tr><tr><td>Robinhood Chain</td><td>Official Sequencer</td><td>Arrival time under FCFS ordering</td></tr></tbody></table>

Note: Robinhood Chain uses First-Come, First-Served ordering. Transaction order depends on arrival time at the Sequencer, and a higher fee cannot move a transaction ahead of one that arrived earlier. The submission path is therefore a direct competitive variable.

### Recommended Services

BlockRazor provides low-latency infrastructure for Sniper and Copy Trading Bots across both signal monitoring and transaction submission.

#### Signal Monitoring Services

> Sniper and Copy Trading Bots can use the same monitoring services. The difference lies in the signals each bot filters and parses.

> Signal monitoring services determine when a bot can act. Transaction submission services determine when the transaction reaches the ordering node. Prefer a regional endpoint close to the bot's deployment location.

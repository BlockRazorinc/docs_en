# Base eth\_sendRawTransaction(tip)

### Introduction

`eth_sendRawTransaction(tip)` is a transaction sending interface provided by BlockRazor for Base, used to send signed transactions with lower latency. It currently supports standard JSON-RPC style requests, allowing users to quickly integrate it with their existing sending logic.

The capabilities of `eth_sendRawTransaction` and `eth_sendRawTransaction(tip)` differs, `eth_sendRawTransaction` is more suitable as a standard sending entry point, emphasizing global multi-point deployment and intercontinental leased lines. while `eth_sendRawTransaction(tip)` is better suited for scenarios where the priority is to send single transactions quickly and enter execution path faster.

{% hint style="info" %}
Each transaction sent must include a tip sent to the address `0x9D70AC39166ca154307a93fa6b595CF7962fe8e5`. The minimum tip amount is the greater of 0.000003 ETH or MaxPriorityFee \* 5%.

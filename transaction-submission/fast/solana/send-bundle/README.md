# Send Bundle

{% hint style="warning" %}
Solana's bundle sending service is not bound to the subscription plan, with rate limit default to 3 TPS. API key could be required from [Authentication](../../../../get-started/authentication.md). If you need to increase the TPS limit, please [contact](https://discord.com/invite/qqJuwRb8Nh) us and we will handle it as soon as possible.
{% endhint %}

`Send Bundle` is a bundle sending interface provided by BlockRazor for Solana, used to send signed transactions to the blockchain in bundle form with low latency.

A maximum of four transactions can be sent in a single bundle. These transactions are executed sequentially, and if any one transaction fails, the entire bundle will fail.

To enhance MEV protection, use any valid Solana public key starting with `jitodontfront` and `dontbund1e` in the instructions of the first transaction in the bundle. If the transaction is subjected to a frontrun attack, it will be rejected by the Jito/Harmonic block engine.
